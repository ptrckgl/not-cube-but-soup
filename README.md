# Not Cube But Soup - A 'Fun and Relaxing' Game to Play

- This is a game I made back in 2018. 
- It is a simple 3D platformer, where you move a cube left or right to avoid obstacles, in attempt to reach the end of the level. Doing so will unlock the next level.
- There are 20 total levels, where each level gets progressively harder (I hope).
- Each set of 5 levels has a certain speed, with the latter levels having a higher speed.
- Each level contains a coin. Upon collecting the coin && successfully completing the level in the same run for all 20 levels will allow you to unlock a bonus level, which is the most difficult of all! 
- Completing this bonus level will demonstrate great ability at Not Cube But Soup!
- Use A and D or the left and right arrow keys to move the Soup!
